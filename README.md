# DungeonMasterTools_Backend

This will be the backend of a restful webservice for a set of dungeon master tools. The goal is to create an app that streamlines the micromanagement process during games so there can be more focus on the story, roleplay, and battles and thus... more memorable games. 

Updates to come: This app is still in the early design phase.
